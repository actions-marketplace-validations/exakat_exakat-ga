# Github Action for Exakat

Scan with the Exakat GitHub Action your PHP code to detect tricky issues, prevent vulnerabilities and control the quality.

Exakat is a customizable static analyzer engine for all PHP 5.2 to PHP 8.0-dev Applications for better Quality, Security, Performance and Documentation


## Usage
The Exakat Github Action has to be declared in your workflow like this:

_.github/workflows/test.yml_

```yaml
on: [push, pull_request]
name: Test
jobs:
  exakat:
    name: Scan with Exakat
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Exakat
      uses: docker://exakat/exakat-ga
```

The `on` event that triggers the workflow can be adapted following the GitHub Action Documentation.

By default an analysis is processed on all rules of the ruleset "CI-checks". The detail of the ruleset is to found in the documentation at: 
https://exakat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Rulesets.html#ci-checks

The Exakat Github Action scans all php files and detects automatically all common libraries and frameworks.

In case you need to scope the analysis, you can use the following optional inputs : 
- `ignore_rules`: is used to **exclude** one or multiple rules during the analysis
- `ignore_dirs`: is used to **exclude** one or multiple directory during the analysis
like this:


```yaml
  uses: docker://exakat/exakat-ga
  with:
    ignore_rules: 'Classes/StaticMethodsCalledFromObject,Php/ShouldUseCoalesce,Functions/UsesDefaultArguments'
    ignore_dirs: '/path/to/repos#1,/path/to/repos#2,/path/to/repos#3'
```

Use the `Short name` to declare a rule to ignore. The name of the rule is to found in the documentation at: 
https://exakat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Rulesets.html#ci-checks
Example : For rule '@ Operator', the `Short name` is 'Structures/Noscream'

## A PHP Gate in the Workflow
The Exakat GitHub Action raises a failure in the Workflow at the first issue detected. 

The Exakat GitHub Action exposes all the results in Perfile style.

Be aware that all our rules are fully documentated with code examples to apply remadiation.

We recommend you configure your important analysis for a better PHP Code control.

## Run Locally Docker 
A Docker-Image is built automatically and located here:
https://hub.docker.com/r/exakat/exakat-ga

You can run this image locally, with the following Docker command : 

`docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/app exakat/exakat-ga:latest`

`$PWD` supposes the code to analyze is in the current folder. Adapt if needed.
