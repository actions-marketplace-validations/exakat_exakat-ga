# Github Action for Exakat

Scan with the Exakat GitHub Action your PHP code to detect tricky issues, prevent vulnerabilities and control the quality.

Exakat is a customizable static analyzer engine for all PHP 5.2 to PHP 8.2-dev Applications for better Quality, Security, Performance and Documentation

## Usage
The Exakat Github Action has to be declared in your workflow like this:

_.github/workflows/compatibility.php80.yml

```yaml
on: [push, pull_request]
name: Test
jobs:
  exakat:
    name: Compabitibility PHP 8.0 with Exakat
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Exakat
      uses: docker://exakat/exakat-ga-compatibility-php-80
```

The `on` event that triggers the workflow can be adapted following the GitHub Action Documentation.

By default an analysis is processed on all rules of the ruleset "CI-checks". The detail of the ruleset is to found in the documentation at: 
https://exakat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Rulesets.html#ci-checks

The Exakat Github Action scans all php files and detects automatically all common libraries and frameworks.

## A PHP Gate in the Workflow
The Exakat GitHub Action raises a failure in the Workflow at the first issue detected. 

The Exakat GitHub Action exposes all the results in Perfile style.
